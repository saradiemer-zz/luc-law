        <p class="body">There is no required or recommended undergraduate major or set of courses to prepare for law school. Students are admitted to law school each year from a wide range of academic majors. Some choose to major in somewhat traditional areas such as political science, English, history, etc. others in subjects such as music, engineering and fine arts. It is recommended that you select a major and choose courses that are both challenging and of interest to you. For applicants to Loyola, the five most popular majors are Economics, English, Finance, Political Science and Psychology.
