            <p>“...Right now, the program I’m in is Shelter Care Plus Permanent Housing... I’m going to Truman College for GED classes...I come to any class that will give me a certificate and that I feel like I accomplished something, because the majority of my life growing up, I come from a dysfunctional family to where, I always wanted to accomplish things [but] I never got a chance to achieve and here [at HOW] I’ve been achieving my goals."</p>

            <p>“About 1990, I got involved in Chicago Coalition for the Homeless. It inspired me. It woke up something socially conscious and just in me. It inspired me to get my life in order. So I went into detox and got myself clean and joined the 12 step program. I’ve been an avid member since that time to this very day.</p>
            <p>“I’m not looking to do anything spectacular. Most of my life is behind [me] anyway, you know...Society will ultimately, hopefully, be able to encourage some of our public officials to be a bit people-concerned for a change. I don’t mean lobbyists or big industry you know, but grassroots, everyday people.”</p>
